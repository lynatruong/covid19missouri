# Web Scraping COVID-19 Cases Data from Missouri State Website
In June 2020, I was an intern for the COVID-19 Data Project on the Emergency Data Relief team. 
My responsibilities included entering daily COVID-19 case data for various states. To gain more experience with 
web scraping in R, I tried to automate the process by creating an R script to scrape COVID-19 case data 
for all the counties in Missouri. At the time, the Missouri Health Department was posting the COVID-19 case 
data in a tabular format on their website, updated on a daily basis. 

Note: As of Jan 2021, the Missouri Dept of Health website now reports their case data in a dashboard.
